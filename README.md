# Dog Behavior classification
In this project, a classification algorithm will be trained that can assign dog motion data measured by sensors to a motion class. For this purpose, the data was previously processed (cleaning, windowing, upsampling) and different algorithms were tested. The selected random forest classifier will be optimized and feature engineering will be performed.
